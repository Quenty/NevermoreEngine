	Octree implementation. An octree is a data structure that allows for quick spatial
	data queries of static objects. For example, trees can be stored in an octree, and
	nearby trees could be found near the player.

	Octrees exists as a grid of nodes, which are subdivided in half in each axis, which
	results in 8 different regions. This recursively happens to a set depth.

	This allows for O(n) data storage and log(n) retrieval of nearby objects. With a large
	quantity of items in the octree, this can make data retrieval significantly faster.

	See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree

	```lua
	local octree = Octree.new()
	octree:CreateNode(Vector3.zero, "A")
	octree:CreateNode(Vector3.zero, "B")
	octree:CreateNode(Vector3.zero, workspace)
	octree:CreateNode(Vector3.new(0, 0, 1000), "C")
	print(octree:RadiusSearch(Vector3.zero, 100)) --> { "A", "B", workspace }
	```

	:::tip
	Octrees are best for static objects in the world, and not objects moving around, since then
	data can be statically cached.

	Sometimes using Roblox's spatial hash using the region API is faster than using an octree. However,
	for data that is centralized, or static, an octree can be a very efficient spatial query mechanism.

	That said, it is totally fine to track the objects that DO move around using octree, as long as you
	apply proper optimizations. The main performance cost of doing this comes down to tracking and
	updating the position of the objects, which is fine if:
		1) You have a way to detect the movement without having to loop through all the moving
		objects to update the position
		2) You can tolerate some inaccuracy with positions and smear this update
		3) You have less than 1000 objects to track, in this case looping through everything
		shouldn't be too costly.
