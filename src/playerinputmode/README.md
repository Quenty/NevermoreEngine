```

## Design
It's oftentimes useful to know if a player is on mobile, pc, or xbox. However, we're platform agnostic, so instead we'll expose input types, which tend to also affect controls, and other things. This information is useful, not just to us, as developers, but also other players in terms of exposing what behavior they should expect from a player.
