	This bootstraps both the server and the client code for pretty soft shutdown logic.

	Originally written by Merely, this is Quenty's version of it from here:
	https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine

	This version supports a nice UI and reserved servers in a normal usage.

	INSTRUCTIONS:
	Insert into ServerScriptService. This script will take care of the rest of it.
