Tie allows interfaces to be defined between Lua OOP and Roblox objects. This is designed in part to replace BinderGroups, which were a way to previously allow systems to interface with each other in a generic way. Instead, an object may implement a TieInterface, which is basically bindable functions/events.

## Installation
```
npm install @quenty/tie --save
```

## Design philosophy
This package does two things. First of all, it basically automates the creation of interfaced definitions, that is, tying a Lua object to BindableEvent/BindableFunction definitions. Second of all, it lets objects be centralized as an interface definition.

## Changes to make

1. Ensure tie properties can be attributes
1. Allow tie functions instead of methods
1. Add tie library as a primary interface (less OOP)
1. Ensure you can ad-hoc create a tie (low-level scripting)
1. Support tagged ties with
1. Ensure ties can be queried via CollectionService
1. Allow client implementation of server-based ties
