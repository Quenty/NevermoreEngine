	Promises to stream the area around the player at the given position. See [Player.RequestStreamAroundAsync]. Can
	be called on both the client and the server.

		:Then(function()

	Returns a resolved promise if streaming is not enabled as the area is guaranteed to be streamed in already.

	:::warning
	Requesting streaming around an area is not a guarantee that the content will be present when the request completes,
	as streaming is affected by the client's network bandwidth, memory limitations, and other factors.
