# Conventions

Coding conventions used across the Nevermore codebase. These guides help contributors write code that matches the project style.

- **[Luau Conventions](luau.md)** — Strict typing patterns, class structure, common type imports, and naming conventions for Luau packages.
- **[TypeScript Conventions](typescript.md)** — Naming, command patterns, error handling, and dryrun support for CLI tools under `tools/`.
- **[Git Workflow](git-workflow.md)** — Commit messages, interactive rebase, branching, and PR conventions (shared across Luau and TypeScript).
