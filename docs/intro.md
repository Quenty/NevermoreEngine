# What is Nevermore?

Nevermore is a ModuleScript loader for Roblox, and loads modules by name. Nevermore is designed to make code more portable. Nevermore comes with a variety of utility libraries. These libraries are used on both the client and server and are useful for a variety of things. These libraries are separated into packages that can be consumed individually using npm.

Nevermore follows both functional and OOP programming paradigms. However, many modules return classes, and may require more advance Lua knowledge to use.
