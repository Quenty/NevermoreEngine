# os
This extends the os table to include os.date! It functions just like Lua's built-in os.date, but with a few additions.

Note: Padding can be toggled by inserting a '_' like so: os.date("%_x", os.time())

Note: tick() is the default unix time used for os.date()

```lua
os.date("*t")
```
returns a table with the following indices:
```
hour    14
min     36
wday    1
year    2003
yday    124
month   5
sec     33
day     4
```
String reference:
```
!   Placing this at the beginning of the string sets the unix parameter to os.time()

os.clock() returns how long the server has been active

Note: os.clock() uses wait() to get how long the server has been active, so the thread will yield momentarily.
