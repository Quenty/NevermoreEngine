## Integration test

This is a test integration place that demonstrates several pakages working in coordination with each other, as well as the general structure that one could use to setup a game.

It includes a few interactive elements using binders, as well as localization strategies, strategies for input for specific players, interaction with the IK system, and usage of the octree.

Of note, is client-side specific input, that is, rendering stuff for one client based upon global state (for example, contextual awareness of game-state).
