# About
Nevermore Engine is a module-loader designed to simplify the loading of libraries and unify the networking of resources between the client and server. Nevermore comes equipped with a large codebase of useful libraries intended to streamline game development on Roblox.

## Features

* **OOP** - Many of Nevermore's libraries employ Object-Oriented Programming
* **Lazy loading** - Libraries won't load unless asked to (Consequently, Nevermore will not impact game performance)
* **Many useful libraries** - Nevermore's libraries handle logical issues to decrease the number of code-based errors that occur during game development
* **Tested** - Nevermore functions properly without testing
* **Simple** - Nevermore is designed with simplicity in mind:
	* The loader itself only includes 105 lines of code
	* Fast and easy install; just paste [installer code](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine/blob/master/Install.lua) into Command Bar
* **Open source** - Nevermore is open source. Includes modules contributed by experienced scripters!
* **Built for Roblox** - Made specifically for use on Roblox
* **Works well with existing frameworks** - Nevermore doesn't interfere with existing code

# Get Nevermore
To Install Nevermore, paste the following code into your command bar.

```lua
local a=game:GetService("HttpService")local b=game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")local c=game:GetService("ServerScriptService")local d=a.HttpEnabled;a.HttpEnabled=true;local function e(f)f=f:gsub("\\","/"):gsub("^%s*(.-)%s*$","%1")return a:GetAsync("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine/master/"..f)end;local function g(h,f)local i=f:gmatch("(%w+)%.lua")()local j=h:FindFirstChild(i)or Instance.new("ModuleScript",h)j.Name=i;j.Source=e(f)or error("Unable to load script")return j end;local function k(h,f)local l=f:gmatch("%w+\\")()if l then l=l:sub(1,#l-1)local j=h:FindFirstChild(l)or Instance.new("Folder",h)j.Name=l;return k(j,f:sub(#l+2,#f))else return h end end;print("Loading Nevermore")g(b,"App/NevermoreEngine.lua")print("Loading sublibraries")local m=k(c,"Nevermore\\")local n={}for o in e("Modules/ModuleList.txt"):gmatch("[^\r\n]+")do n[#n+1]=o end;for p,o in pairs(n)do g(k(m,o),"Modules/"..o)print(p,"/",#n)end;a.HttpEnabled=d;print("Done loading")
```
## What you just got:

* The main NevermoreModule in `ReplicatedStorage`
* All the modules in `ServerScriptService`

Please note that installing Nevermore will **not** change any behavior in your game. Nevermore does not affect preexisting code. If you want to see the power of Nevermore try using some [Admin Commmands](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine/tree/master/Modules/NevermoreCommands).


# Updating Nevermore

To update Nevermore, **back up your place file** and run the install code above. Existing code will be preserved, however, Nevermore's default libraries will be overridden.

----


## Usage
To load Nevermore on your server and client, use the following header code:


```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

local LoadCustomLibrary = require(ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("NevermoreEngine"))
```

### Loading a library
With the above code, you can easily load a library and all dependencies

```lua
local qSystems = LoadCustomLibrary("qSystems")
```

Libraries have different functions with a variety of useful methods. For example, let's say we want to make a lava brick.

Vanilla RobloxLua code to turn all `Part`s into killing bricks:
```lua
local function HandleTouch(Part)
	-- Recursively find the humanoid
	local Humanoid = Part:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")
	if not Humanoid then
		if Part.Parent then
			return HandleTouch(Part.Parent)
		end
	elseif Humanoid:IsA("Humanoid") then
		Part.Humanoid:TakeDamage(100)
	end
end

local function RecurseApplyLava(Parent)
	for _, Item in pairs(Parent:GetChildren()) do
		if Item:IsA("BasePart") then
			Item.Touched:connect(HandleTouch)
		end

		RecurseApplyLava(Item)
	end
end

RecurseApplyLava(workspace)
```

Simpler code utilizing Nevermore's libraries:

```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local LoadCustomLibrary = require(ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("NevermoreEngine"))

local qSystems = LoadCustomLibrary("qSystems")

local function HandleTouch(Part)
	local Humanoid = qSystems.GetHumanoid(Part)
	if Humanoid then
		Humanoid:TakeDamage(100)
	end
end

qSystems.CallOnChildren(workspace, function(Item)
	if Item:IsA("BasePart") then
		Item.Touched:connect(HandleTouch)
	end
end)
```


## Manual Installation
Put `NevermoreEngine.lua`'s content's in `game.ReplicatedStorage` in a ModuleScript name `NevermoreEngine`

Put all the modules in a folder in `game.ServerScriptStorage` and name them the names of their script, but without
.lua

```
game
	ReplicatedStorage
		`ModuleScript` NevermoreEngine
	ServerScriptStorage
		`Folder` Nevermore
			`Folder` qSystems
				`ModuleScript` qSystems
				... more libraries
			... more folders and libraries

```

## Update / Change Log
